# Solarius 2.0: Where the Sky is Just the Beginning

## Overview

Solarius 2.0 is an innovative educational platform designed to enhance the learning experience of primary school children by using augmented reality (AR). This project aims to make learning about the Solar System engaging, interactive, and accessible.

## Problem

Traditional methods of teaching the Solar System can be dull and ineffective in capturing students' interest. Solarius 2.0 addresses this by incorporating AR to create a playful and interactive learning environment.

## Objectives

**General Objective:**

- Introduce the Solar System in an engaging way, facilitating learning about each planet and the sun.

**Specific Objectives:**

- Develop a platform that operates on standard mobile devices, eliminating the need for powerful hardware.
- Present information in a simple and comprehensible manner for students.
- Encourage exploration and discovery within the Solar System.

## Solution

Solarius 2.0 will develop an educational game allowing students to explore and understand Solar System concepts through their smartphones, providing a significant and attractive learning experience.

## Experimental Design

Solarius 2.0 includes a comparative study to test the effectiveness of AR in teaching the Solar System versus traditional methods. The study will involve:

- **Independent Variables:**
  - Group A: Use of augmented reality.
  - Group B: Traditional teaching method.
- **Dependent Variables:**
  - Knowledge performance.
  - Student engagement.
  - Information retention.
- **Other Variables:**
  - Previous experience with augmented reality.
  - Access to mobile devices.
